# ESPRIT-Alumni
Integration project of my 4th year as a data science engineering student

This project is considered the first Alumni website in tunisia, it helps students contact former students and recieve guidance as well as seeking the perfect job and developing their CVs and skills.

I chose to work with the CRISP-DM methodology :
* **Phase 1 :** Data collection: School data and LinkedIn scraping (there's another notebook on how to scrape linkedin on my repositories)
* **Phase 2 :** Data preprocessing and Data vizualisation
* **Phase 3 :** Feature engineering
* **Phase 4 :** Modeling (multiple NLP recommendation systems)
* **Phase 5 :** Evaluation and deployment
